## Abstract

This thesis proposes a risk-adaptive extension of the INFFLOW-RT model by introducing incentive-based mechanisms for secure information flow governance in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments.

The research integrates:

- Dependency graph–based risk propagation modeling  
- Multi-order risk analysis  
- Bayesian dynamic risk estimation  
- Fuzzy logic–based decision and enforcement mechanisms  
- Blockchain-enabled decentralized policy enforcement  

The proposed framework aims to enhance Information Flow Control (IFC) by incorporating adaptive trust and incentive structures within distributed systems.
